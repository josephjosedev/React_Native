# Horizontal Scroll in React Native

A Horizontal ScrollView in React Native is a component used to display a list of scrollable items horizontally. It works similarly to the default ScrollView component, but instead of scrolling vertically, it scrolls horizontally. To create a Horizontal ScrollView in React Native, you can use the ScrollView component and set its horizontal property to true.

`true` when `horizontal={true}`
